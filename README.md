I followed the in class example.

Created XML data from https://www.mockaroo.com/ about Plants. There are 4 different components: Family Name, Plant Name, Plant Scientific Name, Plant Info. I got Family Name, 
Plant Name, Plant Scientific Name from https://www.mockaroo.com/ and asked ChatGPT to create me information related to Plants, and I also added plant info to XML data.

In the main page, there are 40 different Family Names and Plant Names. By clicking each of them, you can see all components: Family Name, Plant Name, Plant Scientific Name,
Plant Info.
